Its main roots stem from the founding of the Methodist denomination in England by John Wesley, a priest in the Anglican Church (Church of England) in 1738. Wesley led a group of people who believed the Church should make greater efforts to reach the poor and working class. Because of their structured and methodical forms of services and activities, their associates deridingly called them "Methodist."','assets/images/tmpMedia/Clinton_2012.jpg'),
